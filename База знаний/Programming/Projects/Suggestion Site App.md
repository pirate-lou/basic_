The Plan:
1. The planning process 
	1. Just getting into VS and saying "let's start" -  isn't good enough
	2. You have to know the steps and have to know the end destination 
2. First step:  plan out our application. What you want to accomplish. __If cannot articulate what you want accomplish you wont accomplish it__
3. open up the requirements 
4. User interface design
5. Logic design - this is big picture logic. Have we thought through each peace and do we know how to use each peace - that's important. 'cause if u don't know how to use it don't just learn it and put into ur production application in one step. Make sure that u have practice project that u practice what u learn on first before u put it in the real application. So here is I would identify thinks I've never done before, and say "ohh, I think I need to learn that and so I'd go learn it and practice environment and get comfortable with it and then bring it in to my full application"
6. Data design - the information from the user



add these things to this :
1. focus on basic concepts and dont rush.
2. find objective of learning
3. then find intermediate concepts used generally ( maybe you miss some which are not used regular but if required you can just google it )
4. revision revision , so what ever you learn just revise within 30-40 hours again then lite revision again after a week , this will create new nuro paths , later when you recall even if you forget if you get hint you recall all and then do practice to hard concepts , hope it helps and do have good sleep and while y learn avoid social media and extra stuff and stupid relationships ( you can talk with your person or give specific time or make them busy too , my my objective is not relationship advice but to protect your brain spaces more and yes we are social being you should  hand out but under limit , priorities matters.

1) start as small as possible get just enough out the door to have it working and working well 
2) first design on paper then design in figma other tool
3) understand the topics before u start building a production application
